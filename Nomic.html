<a name="intro"></a><a name="A"></a>
<p><strong><font size="+1">A. Introduction</font></strong></p>
<p>If law-making is a game, then it is a game in which changing the 
rules is a move. Law-making is more than changing the rules of 
law-making, of course, and more than a game. But a real game may model 
the self-amending character of the legal system and leave the rest out. 
 While self-amendment appears to be an esoteric feature of law, 
capturing it in a game creates a remarkably complete microcosm of a 
functional legal system.</p>

<p>Statutes are the paradigm legal rules. Statutes are made by a
rule-governed process that is itself partly statutory. Hence the power 
to make and change statutes can reach some of the rules that govern the 
process itself. Most of the rules that govern the making of statutes, 
however, are constitutional and beyond the reach of the power they 
govern. Congress can change its parliamentary rules, committee 
structure, and revocably bind its future action by its past action, but 
through mere statutes it cannot alter the supermajority needed to 
override an executive veto, abolish one of its houses, start a tax bill 
in the Senate, or even delegate too much of its power to experts.</p>

<p>Statutes cannot affect constitutional rules, but the latter can 
affect the former. This is an important difference of logical priority.
  When a conflict exists between rules of different types, the 
constitutional rules always prevail. This logical difference is matched
 by a political difference:  the logically prior (constitutional) rules 
are more difficult to amend than the logically posterior (statutory) 
rules. That these two differences occur together is not accidental. 
One purpose of making some rules more difficult to change than others is
 to prevent a brief wave of fanaticism from undoing decades or centuries
 of refined structure. It is self-paternalism, our chosen insurance 
against our anticipated weak moments. But that purpose is not met 
unless the two-tier (or multi-tier) system also creates a logical 
hierarchy in which the less mutable rules take logical priority over the
 more mutable rules. Otherwise the more mutable rules could by 
themselves undo basic patterns. If supermajorities and the concurrence 
of many bodies are necessary to protect the foundations of the system 
from hasty change, then that protective purpose is frustrated if those 
foundations are reachable by rules that require only a simple majority 
of a single legislature.</p>

<p>Although all the rules in the American system are mutable, it is 
convenient to refer to the less mutable constitutional rules as 
"immutable" and to the more mutable rules below them in the hierarchy 
simply as "mutable". The same is true in Nomic (from Greek <em>nómos</em>,
 law), where at least initially no rule is literally immutable. If our 
self-paternalism is to be effective, then, the "immutable" rules must 
conjoin logical priority with their defining characteristic of 
resistance to easy amendment. Many systems could have satisfied this 
requirement. Nomic has adopted a simple two-tier system. A system 
could, however, have any number of degrees of difficulty in the 
amendment of rules. Rules that are more difficult to amend must always 
take priority over those that are less difficult to amend in case of 
conflicts, and should contain more fundamental provisions of the legal 
system. Class A rules, the hardest to amend, could require unanimity of
 a central body and unanimous concurrence of all regional bodies. Class
 B rules could require 90% supermajorities, Class C rules 80% 
supermajorities, and so on. The number of such categories could be 
indefinitely large.</p>

<p>If appropriate qualifications are made for the informality of 
custom and etiquette, a case could be made that normal social life is 
just a system of indefinite tiers. Near the top of the "difficult" end 
of the series, below entrenched cultural norms, are actual laws, rising 
through case precedents, regulations and statutes, to constitutional 
rules. At the bottom of the scale are those rules of personal behavior 
that individuals may amend unilaterally without incurring censure. 
Above those are rules for which amendment is increasingly costly, 
starting with (say) costs on the order of furrowed brows and clucked 
tongues, passing through indignant blows and vengeful homicide.</p>

<p>Nomic is unambiguously a two-tier system, whereas the United 
States has such intermediate and anomolous things as administrative 
regulations, joint resolutions, treaties, executive agreements, higher 
and lower court decisions, state practice, parliamentary rules of order,
 judicial rules of procedure and evidence, executive orders, canons of 
professional responsibility, evidentiary presumptions, standards of 
reasonableness, rules for establishing priority among rules, canons of 
interpretation, contractual rules, and so on. Moreover, all legal 
systems have, as Ronald Dworkin has argued, such unwritten rule-like 
things as principles and standards.
  Nomic is a clean two-tier system, rather than a nuanced or multi-tier 
system, for the sake of simplicity and to make the game easier to learn 
and play. This is not to say that nuanced, intermediate levels may not 
arise through game-custom and tacit understandings. Moreover, the 
nature of Nomic allows players to add new tiers by explicit amendment as
 they see fit; and it is easier to add them to a simple game than to 
subtract them from a complex one.</p>

<p>The two-tier system, by complicating the simplicity of a unitary 
system, embodies the same self-paternalistic elements of the federal 
constitution. The "<a href="#immutable">immutable</a>" rules govern more basic processes than the "<a href="#mutable">mutable</a>"
 rules, and so shield them from hasty change. Because every last rule 
of the game can change in the the course of play, the players may feel 
that they are playing a "different game" after a few rounds than when 
they sat down. </p>

<p>In the United States, fundamental constitutional rules are 
mutable, but the procedure for amending them is more difficult than for 
less fundamental statutory rules. In Nomic, the "<a href="#immutable">immutable</a>"
 rules may also be amended. Rather than use a more difficult amending 
procedure, I have adopted a two-step procedure. The first is the 
"transmutation" of the "immutable" rule into a "mutable" rule; the 
second is the amendment of the mutable rule. In this sense all rules 
are amendable by the same procedure; some must simply be transmuted 
first. Unless players change this, Nomic permits the amendment of <em>every</em> one of its rules; there is no absolutely immutable foundation or inviolate level.</p>

<p>Nomic even makes some rules explicit in order to make them 
amendable, when in most games they are implicit —rules to obey the 
rules, rules that players each start with zero points, and so on. No 
tacit understanding that one brings to most games simply <em>qua</em> games, let alone any explicit rule, is beyond the amendment power of Nomic. After Nomic was first published in <em>Scientific American</em>, a German philosopher wrote to me insisting that Rule <a href="#101">101</a>
 (that players should obey the rules) should be omitted from the Initial
 Set and made part of a truly immutable shell. He missed an essential 
point of the game. Rule <a href="#101">101</a> is included precisely so that it can be amended; if players amend or repeal it, they deserve what they get. </p>

<p>The plurality of tiers prevents the logical foundation of the 
game, or the physical activity comprising play, from changing radically 
in just a few moves. Continuity is a virtue of both games and 
governments, but players have an advantage over citizens in that they 
can adjust the degree of continuity and the rate of change at will and 
intelligently, whereas in life these mechanisms are barely known and 
partially beyond the reach of planned action. All other games possess 
the continuity of unchanging rules, or at least of rules that change 
only between, and not during, games. Nomic has more the continuity of a
 legal system than a normal game:  it is a
rule-governed set of processes, systems, and directives undergoing 
constant rule-governed change. The "game" for the purposes of 
presenting it, as in this appendix, is the Initial Set of rules. But 
the "game" is equally the dynamic rule-governed change of the Initial 
Set. The continuing identity of the game, like that of a state, is due 
to the fact (when it is a fact) that all change is the product of 
existing rules properly applied, and none is revolutionary. If 
exceptions to this continuity can be cured for states by acceptance or 
acquiescence or subsequent ratification, I leave it to players to decide
 whether breaches of continuity in Nomic may be cured by an analogous 
social practice.</p>

<p>Nomic includes provision for Judgment (Rule <a href="#212">212</a>),
 not merely to imitate government on another front, but also for the 
reasons that government must make provision for judgment:  rules will 
inevitably be adopted that are ambiguous, inconsistent, or incomplete, 
or that require application to individual circumstances not specified in
 the rule or not anticipated by the framers. "Play" must not be 
interrupted; some agency must be empowered to make an authoritative 
determination so that "play" may continue.</p>

<p>Judgments in Nomic are not bound by rules of precedent, for that 
would require a daunting amount of record-keeping for each game. But 
the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> may be imposed at the players' 
option, or may arise without explicit amendment as successive judges 
feel impelled to treat like cases alike. Without <em>stare decisis</em>
 players are put upon to draft their rules carefully, make thoughtful 
adjudications, overrule poor judgments, and amend defective rules. This
 is one way in which Nomic teaches basic principles and exigencies of 
law, even while it vastly simplifies.</p>

<p>The Initial Set must be sufficiently short and simple to 
encourage play, but sufficiently long and complex to cover contingencies
 likely to arise before the players get around to providing for them in a
 rule. It also needs a certain complexity to prevent any single 
rule-change from disrupting the continuity of the game. Whether my 
Initial Set satisfies these competing interests I leave to players to 
decide. Players who think not may wish to change the Initial Set before
 play rather than rely on amendments during play. They will then play "constitutional convention" more than "legislation".</p>

<p>There is no single AC or amendment rule in Nomic. Rule <a href="#116">116</a>
 permits amendment only when "a rule or rules make [amendment] 
permissible", thus allowing the complete extinguishment of the amendment
 power in principle. Rules <a href="#104">104</a> and <a href="#114">114</a> satisfy <a href="#116">116</a> by guaranteeing the continuing permissibility of some form of "rule-change", which is defined by <a href="#103">103</a> so as to leave no rule literally immutable. Rules <a href="#202">202</a> through <a href="#206">206</a> presuppose that amendment is permissible; a game-judge may well decide that they also satisfy the need in <a href="#116">116</a> for rules affirmatively permitting amendment. Rules <a href="#202">202</a> and <a href="#203">203</a> articulate the basic procedure of amendment:  proposal and ratification. Rule <a href="#115">115</a> explicitly permits self-application.</p>

<p>Of course all these rules are (initially) subject to change. 
Many rules would have to be amended or repealed before amendment could 
itself become impermissible, and even then a judge (if there were still 
judges) might find an "inherent power" to amend before that too is 
extinguished. I leave to players the challenges of ascertaining (1) 
whether any rules can be made truly immutable while preserving some 
power to amend, and (2) whether the power to amend can completely and 
irrevocably be repealed.</p>

<p>Are games sufficiently different from legal systems to render the
 analysis of self-amendment in Part I inapplicable to them?  Without 
pursuing the question to the lengths it deserves, we may note that a 
game is so much simpler than a legal system, with (almost?) all its 
rules explicit and in definitive form, that the inference model might 
apply without distortion. For these purposes we may want to distinguish
 games like tic-tac-toe and chess from cricket and sand-lot baseball. 
The former are finite and fixed rule-governed games that lose nothing by
 interpretation under the inference model, while the latter have a large
 element of uncodified custom and indeterminacy that may be 
oversimplified and distorted by the inference model. Games like 
sand-lot baseball, moreover, seem to contain a kind of meta-rule that 
permits changes in the rules authorized by consent or acceptance rather 
than by explicit procedures. </p>

<p>On the other hand, a game is not something we are born into; we 
expressly choose whether or not to play. Hence principles of contract 
or acceptance are peculiarly applicable to games. The elective nature 
of games and the comparatively small space they occupy in our lives 
suggest that the authority of game rules derives from the agreement of 
players and not from other rules from which the players cannot escape 
without great difficulty. If so, then Hart's acceptance model would 
apply to games much more perspicuously than Ross's inference model.</p>

<p>In addition to teaching many basic principles and pressures of a 
legal system, and allowing more intelligent adjustment of the degree of 
continuity and rate of change, Nomic has turned out to have many other 
unique and intriguing features. In other games, inept moves are their 
own punishments. Either they  create a less interesting game or they 
increase the risk of defeat for their perpetrators. Initially the same 
is true for Nomic, but it need not remain true. The ineptness of a move
 may be measured along many parameters. A measure of ineptness may be 
instituted by rule, and then "inept" rules immediately met with 
punishment, price, or prohibition. In this way Nomic —like law— allows 
the blurring of a distinction fundamental to most other games:  the 
distinction between constitutive rules and rules of skill, or between 
lawful and artful play, between permissible and optimal action.</p>

<p>Similarly, most other games do not embrace non-play and do not 
become paradoxical by seeming to do so. Children often invent games 
that provide game-penalties for declining invitations to play, or that 
extend
game-jurisdiction to all of "real life" and end only when the children 
tire or forget. ("Daddy, Daddy, come play a new game we invented!"  
"No, sweetheart, I'm reading."  "That's 10 points!")  Law does this too.
  One cannot choose not to play criminal law, and kill someone with 
impunity, or choose not to play tax law. These choices are not 
recognized by the rules of the "law game" as valid moves; one is liable 
anyway. Nomic can become law-like in this way, or child-like in the 
former way, to an arbitrary degree. A game of Nomic may embrace 
anything at the vote of the players. The line between play and non-play
 may shift at each turn, or it may apparently be eliminated. Players 
may be governed by the game when they think they are in between games or
 when they think they have quit. Part of the rationale of Rule <a href="#113">113</a>
 is to minimize the only obvious, disadvantageous consequence of this 
feature, or to require an explicit vote to institute those consequences.</p>

<p>For most games there is an infallible decision procedure to 
determine the legality of a move. In Nomic situations may easily arise 
in which it is very hard to determine whether a move is legal. 
Moreover, paradoxes may arise in Nomic that paralyze judgment. 
Occasionally this will be due to the poor drafting of a rule, but it may
 also arise from a rule that is
well-drafted but mischievous. The variety of such paradoxes is truly 
impossible to anticipate. Rule <a href="#213">213</a> is designed to 
cope with them as well as possible without cluttering the Initial Set 
with too many legalistic qualifications. Note that Rule <a href="#213">213</a>
 allows a wily player to create a paradox, get it passed (if the rule 
seems innocent enough to the other players), and thereby win.

<a name="how to play"></a><a name="B"></a></p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">B. How to play Nomic</font></strong></p>

<p>Nomic is a game in which changing the rules is a move. In that 
respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity 
of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of 
changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and 
cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of
 course, can be changed.</p>

<p>Because the rules are always changing, there is no absolute set 
of rules to Nomic. There is only the starting or initial set of rules. 
 There are 29 numbered rules in the Initial Set. Most are "procedural" 
and govern the process of changing the rules or the facts of life in a 
game where the rules are always changing. The chief exception is 
Initial Rule <a href="#202">202</a>, which should be read first. Rule <a href="#202">202 </a>is
 practically the only "substantive" rule in the Initial Set. It tells 
how to earn points to win. The mechanism is as simple as possible:  one
 throws a die or makes a calculation. The substantive portion of the 
game is deliberately simple so that the players can decide, through 
rule-changes, what kind of game they want to play. If they make no 
decision here, they will be fully occupied in what I call a "procedural"
 game, which many players choose deliberately. In a substantive game, 
players aim to score points and win. In a procedural game, players try 
to tie the rules into the most interesting knots imaginable and to win 
not by points (Rule <a href="#208">208</a>) but by paradox (Rule <a href="#213">213</a>).</p>

<p>Two can play, but three or more make for a better game. With 
only two players, there is no (initial) difference between unanimity and
 majority rule, which takes away a lot of the fun. For two-person 
games, I recommend that an early rule-change add at least one "robot" 
player who cannot propose changes but who can vote on them by some 
mechanism (e.g. by a throw of the die). That way two humans can 
simulate a larger game and distinguish unanimity from lesser majorities.</p>

<p>Players will need paper and pencil and, at least in the beginning of
face-to-face games, one die. Each player should have a copy of the Initial Set of rules to consult.</p>

<p>The physical method of play, other than the die and a requirement
 to write down all rule-changes, is not specified in the rules. Players
 can keep track of rule-changes in any way they like. One good way is 
as follows. Take 29 index cards and number them from 101 to 116 and 
from 201 to 213. Lay them out on the floor or a large table. Their 
layout (and perhaps their color as well) should indicate which rules are
 "<a href="#immutable">immutable</a>" (101-116) and which are "<a href="#mutable">mutable</a>" (201-213).</p>

<p>New proposals for rule-changes are also written on index cards, 
or (to save money) on scratch pads of the same size. If a proposal is 
adopted, the card is put in its place in the numerical order. If a 
proposal is an amendment to an existing rule, it lies on top of the card
 whose rule it amends. If a rule is repealed, its card is simply 
removed. Save the 29 cards numbered with the Initial Set for use in 
future games.</p>

<p>For more complex games players may prefer to transcribe into 
their own notebooks the text of each new rule or amendment and to keep a
 separate list, by number, of the rules still in effect. If this method
 is adopted, the rules should probably define a "master book" that 
contains the authoritative text of each rule in case of conflicts or 
transcribing errors.</p>

<p>The constantly changing body of rules makes Nomic a natural for 
word processors. Players who can share equipment or use a network to 
display the same file of rules might try to do so. A single player 
should probably be assigned the responsibility of entering and editing 
the text. Computers will permit very complex, long-term games to 
develop. Players may want to plan ahead when they start such a game, 
attempt to date each amendment and addition, and provide separate files 
for amended and repealed rules, and defeated proposals, in order to keep
 a record of the game.</p>

<p>Players who try to go beyond text processing and actually put 
some Nomic bookkeeping in a program are warned that the complexities are
 subtle. First, such a program should be as easy to modify as the rules
 of the game, or else the difficulty of changing it will put an unwanted
 brake on play. Moreover, it is very easy inadvertently to give the 
program decisions to make that are not actually clerical and that belong
 to the players, that is, to change Nomic without realizing it. This is
 true even of the most deceptively simple decisions such as renumbering 
rules after amendment, computing scores, and deciding who plays next. 
For the same reasons, mere word processing can introduce distortions. 
Decisions necessary to write a program or edit text may require a 
precision not explicit in the rule as written, in which case the 
programmer usurps the power of the game Judge if she simply chooses a 
reading of the rule. In any case, the game Judge should be the final 
arbiter of all questions and decisions, even those made by a program, 
unless of course a rule has changed the role of the Judge.</p>

<p></p><center><font size="+1"><strong>Initial Set of Rules</strong></font></center>

<a name="immutable"></a>
<p></p><center><em><strong>Immutable Rules</strong></em></center>

<a name="101"></a>
<p><strong>101.</strong>  All players must always abide by all the rules
 then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The 
rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The 
Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-213 (mutable).</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="102"></a>
<p><strong>102.</strong>  Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and
 rules in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or 
transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or <em>vice versa</em>)
 may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in 
the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="103"></a>
<p><strong>103.</strong>  A rule-change is any of the following:  (1) 
the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the 
enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule; or 
(3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or <em>vice versa</em>. </p>

<p>(Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all new
 rules are mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable, may 
not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are mutable, 
may be amended or repealed; any rule of any status may be transmuted; no
 rule is absolutely immune to change.)</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="104"></a>
<p><strong>104.</strong>  All rule-changes proposed in the proper way 
shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the
 required number of votes.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="105"></a>
<p><strong>105.</strong>  Every player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on rule-changes.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="106"></a>
<p><strong>106.</strong>  All proposed rule-changes shall be written 
down before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they shall guide 
play in the form in which they were voted on.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="107"></a>
<p><strong>107.</strong>  No rule-change may take effect earlier than 
the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its 
wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule-change may have 
retroactive application.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="108"></a>
<p><strong>108.</strong>  Each proposed rule-change shall be given a 
number for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each 
rule-change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive
 integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.</p>

<p>If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of 
the proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it 
receives the number of the proposal to amend or transmute it. If an 
amendment is amended or repealed, the entire rule of which it is a part 
receives the number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="109"></a>
<p><strong>109.</strong>  Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules 
into mutable rules may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous 
among the eligible voters. Transmutation shall not be implied, but must
 be stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="110"></a>
<p><strong>110.</strong>  In a conflict between a mutable and an 
immutable rule, the immutable rule takes precedence and the mutable rule
 shall be entirely void. For the purposes of this rule a proposal to 
transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that immutable 
rule. </p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="111"></a>
<p><strong>111.</strong>  If a rule-change as proposed is unclear, 
ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably 
consists of two or more rule-changes compounded or is an amendment that 
makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then 
the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal 
before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. 
The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be 
voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the
 time to end debate and vote. </p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="112"></a>
<p><strong>112.</strong>  The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving <em>n</em> points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of <em>n</em>
 and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that 
establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while 
they are mutable) be amended or repealed.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="113"></a>
<p><strong>113.</strong>  A player always has the option to forfeit the 
game rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty 
worse than losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be 
imposed.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="114"></a>
<p><strong>114.</strong>  There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="115"></a>
<p><strong>115.</strong>  Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow
 or apply rule-changes are as permissible as other rule-changes. Even 
rule-changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. 
No rule-change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the
 self-reference or self-application of a rule.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="116"></a>
<p><strong>116.</strong>  Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a 
rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules 
explicitly or implicitly permits it.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="mutable"></a>
<p></p><center><em><strong>Mutable Rules</strong></em></center>

<a name="201"></a>
<p><strong>201.</strong>  Players shall alternate in clockwise order, 
taking one whole turn apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and 
parts of turns may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points.</p>

<p>In mail and computer games, players shall alternate in alphabetical order by surname.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="202"></a>
<p><strong>202.</strong>  One turn consists of two parts in this order: 
(1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and (2) throwing 
one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score.</p>

<p>In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players 
subtract 291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the 
result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the 
nearest integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first 
player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points 
are awarded for more popular proposals.)</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="203"></a>
<p><strong>203.</strong>  A rule-change is adopted if and only if the 
vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. If this rule is not 
amended by the end of the second complete circuit of turns, it 
automatically changes to require only a simple majority.</p>

<p><strong>204.</strong>  If and when rule-changes can be adopted 
without unanimity, the players who vote against winning proposals shall 
receive 10 points each.</p>

<p><strong>206.</strong>  When a proposed rule-change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.</p>

<p><strong>208.</strong>  The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive) points.</p>

<p>In mail and computer games, the winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points.</p>

<p><strong>210.</strong>  Players may not conspire or consult on the making of future rule-changes unless they are team-mates.</p>

<p>The first paragraph of this rule does not apply to games by mail or computer.</p>

<p><strong>211.</strong>  If two or more mutable rules conflict with one
 another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, 
then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.</p>

<p>If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of 
itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes 
precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions 
shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.</p>

<p>If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or
 to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.</p>

<p></p><center>*</center>

<a name="212"></a>
<p><strong>212.</strong>  If players disagree about the legality of a 
move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the player 
preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. 
Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the 
insistence of any player. This process is called invoking Judgment.</p>

<p>When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin his
 or her turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.</p>

<p>The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of
 the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's 
Judgment is overruled, then the player preceding the Judge in the 
playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except 
that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the 
turn of a team-mate. </p>

<p>Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions 
arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions 
as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.</p>

<p>New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New 
Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players 
currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which 
Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance 
with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, 
inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall 
consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other 
standards. </p>

<p><strong>213.</strong>  If the rules are changed so that further play 
is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with 
finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move 
appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player unable to 
complete a turn is the winner.</p>

<p>This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.</p>
