<blockquote>The Democratic Wisdom of the Worshipers is a game in which changing the Patterns of Worship is a move. In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of the Democratic Wisdom is proposing changes in the Patterns, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.</blockquote>

<a name="immutable"></a><p><center><strong><font size="+1">Immutable Patterns of Worship</font></strong></center></p>

<a name="101"></a><p><strong>101.</strong> All worshipers must always abide by all the Patterns of Worship then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The Patterns in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Patterns 101-116 (immutable) and 201-213 (mutable).</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="102"></a><p><strong>102.</strong> Initially Patterns of Worship in the 100's are immutable and Patterns in the 200's are mutable. Patterns subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or <em>vice versa</em>) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and Patterns in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="103"></a><p><strong>103.</strong> A Pattern-change is any of the following: (1) the Holy Sanction (enactment), Holy Destruction (repeal), or Holy Reformation (amendment) of a mutable Patterns; (2) the Holy Sanction (enactment), Holy Destruction (repeal), or Holy Reformation (amendment) of a Holy Reformation of a mutable Pattern; or (3) the Holy Transmutation (transmutation) of an immutable Pattern into a mutable Pattern or <em>vice versa</em>. </p>

<p>(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new Patterns are mutable; immutable Patterns, as long as they are immutable, may not be amended or repealed; mutable Patterns, as long as they are mutable, may be amended or repealed; any Pattern of any status may be transmuted; no Pattern is absolutely immune to change.)</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="104"></a><p><strong>104.</strong> All Pattern-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="105"></a><p><strong>105.</strong> Every worshipers is eligible for Quorum. Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on Pattern-changes.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="106"></a><p><strong>106.</strong> All proposed Pattern-changes shall be written down before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were voted on.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="107"></a><p><strong>107.</strong> No Pattern-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No Pattern-change may have retroactive application.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="108"></a><p><strong>108.</strong> Each proposed Pattern-change shall be given a number for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Pattern-change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.</p>

<p>If a Patterns of Worship is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of the proposal to reenact it. If a Pattern is reformed or transmuted, it receives the number of the proposal to reform or transmute it. If an amendment is reformed or destroyed, the entire Pattern of which it is a part receives the number of the proposal to reform or destroy the amendment.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="109"></a><p><strong>109.</strong> Pattern-changes that transmute immutable Patterns of Worship into mutable Patterns of Worship may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible Quorum of Worshipers. Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="110"></a><p><strong>110.</strong> In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable Pattern of Worship, the immutable Pattern takes precedence and the mutable Pattern shall be entirely void. For the purposes of this Pattern a proposal to transmute an immutable Pattern does not "conflict" with that immutable Pattern. </p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="111"></a><p><strong>111.</strong> If a Pattern-change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more Pattern-changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other worshipers may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to end debate and vote. </p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="112"></a><p><strong>112.</strong> The state of affairs that constitutes reaching Enlightenment may not be altered from achieving <em>n</em> points to any other state of ffairs. The magnitude of <em>n</em> and the means of earning points may be changed, and Patterns of Worship that establish a way to reach Enlightenment when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="113"></a><p><strong>113.</strong> A worshipers always has the option to discontinue worship rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the worshipers to incur it, may be imposed.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="114"></a><p><strong>114.</strong> There must always be at least one mutable Pattern of Worship. The adoption of Pattern-changes must never become completely impermissible.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="115"></a><p><strong>115.</strong> Pattern-changes that affect Patterns of Worship needed to allow or apply Pattern-changes are as permissible as other Pattern-changes. Even Pattern-changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No Pattern-change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a Pattern of Worship.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="116"></a><p><strong>116.</strong> Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Patterns of Worship is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Patterns, which is permitted only when a Pattern or set of Patterns explicitly or implicitly permits it.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<p><center><img src="Nomic_files/newrule.gif" width="239" height="27" border="0"></center></p>
<a name="mutable"></a><p><center><strong><font size="+1">Mutable Patterns of Worship</font></strong></center></p>

<a name="202"></a><p><strong>202.</strong> One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one Pattern-change and having it voted on, and (2) throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score.</p>

<p>In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, worshipers subtract 291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first worshipers, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.) </p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="204"></a><p><strong>204.</strong> If and when Pattern-changes can be adopted without unanimity, the worshipers who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10 points each.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="205"></a><p><strong>205.</strong> An adopted Pattern-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="206"></a><p><strong>206.</strong> When a proposed Pattern-change is defeated, the worshipers who proposed it loses 10 points.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="207"></a><p><strong>207.</strong> Each worshipers always has exactly one vote.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="210"></a><p><strong>210.</strong> Worshipers may not conspire or consult on the making of future Pattern-changes unless they are team-mates.</p>

<p>The first paragraph of this Pattern of Worship does not apply to games by mail or computer.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="211"></a><p><strong>211.</strong> If two or more mutable Patterns of Worship conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable Patterns conflict with one another, then the Pattern with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.</p>

<p>If at least one of the Patterns of Worship in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another Patterns (or type of Patterns) or takes precedence over another Patterns (or type of Patterns), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.</p>

<p>If two or more Patterns of Worship claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="212"></a><p><strong>212.</strong> If worshipers disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a Pattern of Worship, then the worshipers preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this Pattern may be created by the insistence of any worshipers. This process is called invoking Judgment.</p>

<p>When Judgment has been invoked, the next worshipers may not begin his or her turn without the consent of a majority of the other worshipers.</p>

<p>The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other worshipers taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then the worshipers preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no worshipers is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.</p>

<p>Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge. </p>

<p>New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the worshipers currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards. </p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="213"></a><p><strong>213.</strong> If the Patterns of Worship are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first worshipers unable to complete a turn reaches Enlightenment.</p>

<p>This Pattern of Worship takes precedence over every other Pattern determining reaching Enlightenment.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="302"></a><p><strong>302.</strong> A Pattern-change is adopted if and only if the vote has a simple majority among the eligible Quorum of Worshipers.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="303"></a><p><strong>303.</strong> Worshipers can skip turns if they desire, however doing so will count as a failed Pattern of Worship.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="305"></a><p><strong>305.</strong> Patterns of Worship should contain proper capitalization.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="306"></a><p><strong>306.</strong> Worshipers shall alternate in alphabetical order by surname. All worshipers joining in gain starting points equal to the mean of all other worshipers.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="307"></a><p><strong>307.</strong> Everyday that the Democratic Wisdom of the Worshipers is active, worshipers can choose to submit a picture of themselves in hats to gain 5 additional points. The hat must be different every time.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="309"></a><p><strong>309.</strong> Posting the latest image in your camera roll with your Pattern of Worship gives you a 3 point boost if the Pattern passes.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="310"></a><p><strong>310.</strong> Remind the worshipers to stay hydrated by having the bot use an @/everyone ping. But the ping will only happen every third Sunday at 3pm ET.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="311"></a><p><strong>311.</strong> All worshipers have a stat called magic:
<br>(A) That starts at a value of 10.
<br>(B) That has a maximum value of the worshiper's current age.
<br>(C) That replenishes by 11% rounded up of it's current value at the start of each "circuit of turns".
<br>(D) Magic can only be used in ways defined in the Patterns of Worship.
<br>(E) All uses of magic must rhyme.
<br>(F) 10 magic can be used to gain an extra vote, superseding pattern 207.
<br>(G) Magic can be donated to another worshipers past that worshiper's maximum.
</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="312"></a><p><strong>312.</strong> Magic can be used to attack worshipers and steal up to 5 of their their points, but doing so will deplete the attackers magic stat by 5.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="315"></a><p><strong>315.</strong> At least one post per week must start off with the first letter of the first word being capitalized. For example:</p>
<p>“Snakes don’t have any legs” as opposed to “snakes don’t have any legs”</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="316"></a><p><strong>316.</strong> Worshipers may gamble their points against another worshipers(s) in a public game that they agree upon.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="317"></a><p><strong>317.</strong> Once worshipers reach 66 points they have the option of buying an explorable world map for 10 points that will allow them to obtain additional magic points and items. Items earned carry over to the new Great Cycle.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="320"></a><p><strong>320.</strong> When a worshiper surpasses enough points to reach Enlightenment, they must challenge at least 2 other worshipers to a gamble that would cause them to go under that Enlightenmenting amount.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="321"></a><p><strong>321.</strong> The first worshipers to achieve 500 (positive) points reaches Enlightenment.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="323"></a><p><strong>323.</strong> You may get a “priority pass” for your Pattern at the cost of half of your point amount (in case of an odd count, the price shall round down to the nearest even number).</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="324"></a><p><strong>324.</strong><p>(I) KSP is part of this the Democratic Wisdom. You may launch any ship from the SPH or VAB, but you must 'bank' points according to the cost of the ship (Or just ask Nomic):</p>

<p>Sqrt of half of the weight in kilos (1000 kg = 1 tonne) +<br>
5 times the natural log of the base cost +<br>
10 per kerbal</p>

<p>The 'banked' points are stored equally between the kerbals in the ship, and may be gained back when each are recovered. If a ship has no kerbals, it is stored in the base part.</p>

<p>When you start a mission (send pics) take note and say which kerbals you are sending, and how many points they're storing. You complete the mission and report back (with pictures!) in real time. You may play the game at faster than real time, but reports back must be in 1:1 time.</p>

<p>(II) Mods that are purely visual/informational are allowed, such as KER, Alarm Clock, or Planet Shaders.<br>
Also allowed is minor assistance, like MJ for flight assistance, and KOS if you're into that sort of thing.<br>
The only major mod allowed is <a href="https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia">Principia</a>. All other mods are currentely not allowed.</p>

<p>(III) You may spend magic to enable a debugging mode feature for a single ship at any time:<br>
1 - Unbreakable Joints<br>
2 - Infinite Electricity<br>
4 - Ignore Max Temperature<br>
8 - No Crash Damage</p>

<p>(IV) This Pattern introduces 3 ways of getting extra points called "missions", divided into Quests, Contract and Repeatables. Quests can only be done by a single person, first come first serve, such as rescuing a kerbal stuck in orbit. Contract can be done once by each person, this is the default for things like planting a flag on a planet. Repeatables can be done multiple times by the same person, maybe even on the same mission depending on the conditions of the missions.</p>

<p>(V) Lets start off with a set of mission:</p>

<p>Mission 1 (Repeatable):<br>
Name: Where no man has gone before<br>
Goal: Plant a flag on a planet.<br>
Reward: 4 points times the planet's <a href="https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science#Celestial_body_multipliers">landed celestial body multiplier</a>.<br>
Limit: Once per celestial body (planet or moon) per worshipers.</p>

<p>Mission 2 (Contract):<br>
Name: It's getting hot in here<br>
Goal: Crash into the surface of the sun.<br>
Reward: 50 points.</p>

<p>Mission 3 (Contract):<br>
Name: Aerophile<br>
Goal: Put a flag on the north pole without leaving the atmosphere.<br>
Reward: 15 points</p>

<p>Mission 4 (Repeatable):<br>
Name: Bunker up.<br>
Goal: Start a base on a body with at least 6 Kerbals.<br>
Reward: The cost of the ship, plus 6 time times the <a href="https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science#Celestial_body_multipliers">landed celestial body multiplier</a>.<br>
Limit: Once per celestial body per worshiper, and if the base is removed the reward is invalidated.</p>

<p>Mission 5 (Repeatable):<br>
Name: Ultron<br>
Goal: Launch an asteroid onto someone's base.<br>
Reward: The price of the AI/Kerbals killed.<br>
Limit: None.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="327"></a><p><strong>327.</strong> If the Pattern of Worship is sent at your AM, you can post a picture of your morning sky to gain extra points based on the hour number. (e.g. 9 points at 9 AM)</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="329"></a><p><strong>329.</strong> Every 7th Pattern of Worship will require the worshipers to not only post the Pattern in a written form but also verbally by sending a recording of them reciting said Pattern.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="330"></a><p><strong>330.</strong> Posting a meme gets you 2 points (48 hours cooldown)</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="331"></a><p><strong>331.</strong> Posting a photo of a Subway with unique ingredients gets you 2 points (ingredients must be included with photo)</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="333"></a><p><strong>333.</strong> All worshipers have a single special role with minor benefits and a title. While playing the game, your title must be in your name to gain it's benefits.</p>

<p>This title and effect can be changed or removed at any time, by taking a vote.</p>

<p>To start:<br>
Hex has the title "Pope": He gains double points (up to 10) from Patterns of Worship while he wears a mitre. This is limited to 5 if he wears a zucchetto.<br>
Cheez has the title "Gamer". He may decide what the effect is by an aforementioned vote.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="334"></a><p><strong>334.</strong> Posting pictures of food that you cooked yourself in the last 3 days and that no one else on the server has cooked before, apart from the aforementioned dish itself, gives you an additional 3 points. This is limited to 9 points each week.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="335"></a><p><strong>335.</strong> Each time a person use the third ☠️ emoji that removes an ugly icon gets 2 points.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="336"></a><p><strong>336.</strong> Taking photos of wildlife and posting them will give you one point.</p>
<p>(Must be a unique species each time a worshipers posts a picture however it's allowed for two or more worshipers to post photos of the same species granted the photo themselves are of different organisms of that species. Only one photo per day, any more will not count and will invalidate the photo for point collection. Wildlife means terrestrial/aquatic animals and insects/arachnids).</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="338"></a><p><strong>338.</strong> Time to turn this into a cult fully, make these renames in all Patterns of Worship:</p>
