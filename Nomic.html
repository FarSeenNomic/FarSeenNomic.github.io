<p><center><font size="+2"><strong>Nomic: A Game of Self-Amendment</strong></font></center></p>

<blockquote>Nomic is a game in which changing the rules is a move. In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.<br />

<a name="immutable"></a><p><center><strong><font size="+1">Immutable Rules</font></strong></center></p>

<a name="101"></a><p><strong>101.</strong> All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-213 (mutable).</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="102"></a><p><strong>102.</strong> Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or <em>vice versa</em>) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="103"></a><p><strong>103.</strong> A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or <em>vice versa</em>. </p>

<p>(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new rules are mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable, may not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are mutable, may be amended or repealed; any rule of any status may be transmuted; no rule is absolutely immune to change.)</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="104"></a><p><strong>104.</strong> All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="105"></a><p><strong>105.</strong> Every player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on rule-changes.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="106"></a><p><strong>106.</strong> All proposed rule-changes shall be written down before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were voted on.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="107"></a><p><strong>107.</strong> No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule-change may have retroactive application.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="108"></a><p><strong>108.</strong> Each proposed rule-change shall be given a number for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.</p>

<p>If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of the proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it receives the number of the proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, the entire rule of which it is a part receives the number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="109"></a><p><strong>109.</strong> Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="110"></a><p><strong>110.</strong> In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the immutable rule takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void. For the purposes of this rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that immutable rule. </p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="111"></a><p><strong>111.</strong> If a rule-change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more rule-changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to end debate and vote. </p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="112"></a><p><strong>112.</strong> The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving <em>n</em> points to any other state of ffairs. The magnitude of <em>n</em> and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="113"></a><p><strong>113.</strong> A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="114"></a><p><strong>114.</strong> There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="115"></a><p><strong>115.</strong> Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule-changes are as permissible as other rule-changes. Even rule-changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule-change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="116"></a><p><strong>116.</strong> Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<p><center><img src="Nomic_files/newrule.gif" width="239" height="27" border="0"></center></p>
<a name="mutable"></a><p><center><strong><font size="+1">Mutable Rules</font></strong></center></p>

<a name="202"></a><p><strong>202.</strong> One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and (2) throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score.</p>

<p>In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players subtract 291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.) </p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="204"></a><p><strong>204.</strong> If and when rule-changes can be adopted without unanimity, the players who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10 points each.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="205"></a><p><strong>205.</strong> An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="206"></a><p><strong>206.</strong> When a proposed rule-change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="207"></a><p><strong>207.</strong> Each player always has exactly one vote.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="210"></a><p><strong>210.</strong> Players may not conspire or consult on the making of future rule-changes unless they are team-mates.</p>

<p>The first paragraph of this rule does not apply to games by mail or computer.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="211"></a><p><strong>211.</strong> If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.</p>

<p>If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.</p>

<p>If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="212"></a><p><strong>212.</strong> If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called invoking Judgment.</p>

<p>When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or her turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.</p>

<p>The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.</p>

<p>Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge. </p>

<p>New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards. </p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="213"></a><p><strong>213.</strong> If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player unable to complete a turn is the winner.</p>

<p>This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="302"></a><p><strong>302.</strong> A rule-change is adopted if and only if the vote has a simple majority among the eligible voters.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="303"></a><p><strong>303.</strong> Players can skip turns if they desire, however doing so will count as a failed rule.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="305"></a><p><strong>305.</strong> Rules should contain proper capitalization.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="306"></a><p><strong>306.</strong> Players shall alternate in alphabetical order by surname. All players joining in gain starting points equal to the mean of all other players.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="307"></a><p><strong>307.</strong> Everyday that the game of Nomic is active, players can choose to submit a picture of themselves in hats to gain 5 additional points. The hat must be different every time.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="309"></a><p><strong>309.</strong> Posting the latest image in your camera roll with your rule gives you a 3 point boost if the rule passes.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="310"></a><p><strong>310.</strong> Remind the players to stay hydrated by having the bot use an @/everyone ping. But the ping will only happen every third Sunday at 3pm ET.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="311"></a><p><strong>311.</strong> All players have a stat called magic:
<br>(A) That starts at a value of 10.
<br>(B) That has a maximum value of the player's current age.
<br>(C) That replenishes by 11% rounded up of it's current value at the start of each "circuit of turns".
<br>(D) Magic can only be used in ways defined in the rules.
<br>(E) All uses of magic must rhyme.
<br>(F) 10 magic can be used to gain an extra vote, superseding rule 207.
<br>(G) Magic can be donated to another player past that players's maximum.
</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="312"></a><p><strong>312.</strong> Magic can be used to attack players and steal up to 5 of their their points, but doing so will deplete the attackers magic stat by 5.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="315"></a><p><strong>315.</strong> At least one post per week must start off with the first letter of the first word being capitalized. For example:</p>
<p>“Snakes don’t have any legs” as opposed to “snakes don’t have any legs”</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="316"></a><p><strong>316.</strong> Players may gamble their points against another player(s) in a public game that they agree upon.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="317"></a><p><strong>317.</strong> Once players reach 66 points they have the option of buying an explorable world map for 10 points that will allow them to obtain additional magic points and items. Items earned carry over to the next game of Nomic.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="320"></a><p><strong>320.</strong> When a player surpasses enough points to win the game, they must challenge at least 2 other players to a gamble that would cause them to go under that winning amount.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="321"></a><p><strong>321.</strong> The winner is the first player to achieve 500 (positive) points.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="323"></a><p><strong>323.</strong> You may get a “priority pass” for your rule at the cost of half of your point amount (in case of an odd count, the price shall round down to the nearest even number).</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="324"></a><p><strong>324.</strong><p>(I) KSP is part of this Nomic. You may launch any ship from the SPH or VAB, but you must 'bank' points according to the cost of the ship (Or just ask Nomic):</p>

<p>Sqrt of half of the weight in kilos (1000 kg = 1 tonne) +<br>
5 times the natural log of the base cost +<br>
10 per kerbal</p>

<p>The 'banked' points are stored equally between the kerbals in the ship, and may be gained back when each are recovered. If a ship has no kerbals, it is stored in the base part.</p>

<p>When you start a mission (send pics) take note and say which kerbals you are sending, and how many points they're storing. You complete the mission and report back (with pictures!) in real time. You may play the game at faster than real time, but reports back must be in 1:1 time.</p>

<p>(II) Mods that are purely visual/informational are allowed, such as KER, Alarm Clock, or Planet Shaders.<br>
Also allowed is minor assistance, like MJ for flight assistance, and KOS if you're into that sort of thing.<br>
The only major mod allowed is <a href="https://github.com/mockingbirdnest/Principia">Principia</a>. All other mods are currentely not allowed.</p>

<p>(III) You may spend magic to enable a debugging mode feature for a single ship at any time:<br>
1 - Unbreakable Joints<br>
2 - Infinite Electricity<br>
4 - Ignore Max Temperature<br>
8 - No Crash Damage</p>

<p>(IV) This rule introduces 3 ways of getting extra points called "missions", divided into Quests, Contract and Repeatables. Quests can only be done by a single person, first come first serve, such as rescuing a kerbal stuck in orbit. Contract can be done once by each person, this is the default for things like planting a flag on a planet. Repeatables can be done multiple times by the same person, maybe even on the same mission depending on the conditions of the missions.</p>

<p>(V) Lets start off with a set of mission:</p>

<p>Mission 1 (Repeatable):<br>
Name: Where no man has gone before<br>
Goal: Plant a flag on a planet.<br>
Reward: 4 points times the planet's <a href="https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science#Celestial_body_multipliers">landed celestial body multiplier</a>.<br>
Limit: Once per celestial body (planet or moon) per player.</p>

<p>Mission 2 (Contract):<br>
Name: It's getting hot in here<br>
Goal: Crash into the surface of the sun.<br>
Reward: 50 points.</p>

<p>Mission 3 (Contract):<br>
Name: Aerophile<br>
Goal: Put a flag on the north pole without leaving the atmosphere.<br>
Reward: 15 points</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="325"></a><p><strong>325.</strong> posting pictures of food that no one else on the server has cooked before gives you an additional 3 points.</p>
<p><center>*</center></p>

<a name="327"></a><p><strong>327.</strong> If the rule is sent at your AM, you can post a picture of your morning sky to gain extra points based on the hour number. (e.g. 9 points at 9 AM)</p>
